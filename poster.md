## (Group) Final Poster

The goal of this assignment is to practice making a poster.  Posters are a common presentation visual for conferences, and you will have to make a poster for clinic, if you choose to take it next year.

I posted a few example posters from previous semesters under Files -> Resources -> Past Projects.


### Poster
This submission should include a **complete and final** version of your poster.  You will get feedback on these, so the better they are, the more useful the feedback will be to you!

Your poster should

* Introduce and motivate your project
* Demonstrate the core functionality of the app -- walk through the main features of your product from both the user perspective as well as any behind-the-scenes features (e.g., fast / novel algorithms, etc.)
* Describe the overall architecture of the app (at a level comprehensible to someone who has taken CS 70)
* (If desired, identify a primary technical challenge and solution -- okay to be more technical here)
* Discuss improvements or future work

From a higher-level view, just consider this poster to be a visual aid. If you were telling somebody about your application, what visual information would you like to be able to point at? What diagrams and images might illustrate interesting parts of your project?

Some logistics:

* Include project name, developer, and client name
* 48' wide x 36' tall (landscape format)
* 150-250 words TOTAL (AVOID TEXT wherever possible)
  * excluding title, names, references
  * text in figures does not count (but do not overload figures!)
* Possible sections:
  * Overview / Summary (concise description of the project)
  * Functionality
  * Architecture
  * Future work
  * Acknowledgments
  * References
* Diagrams are awesome.
* Screenshots are even more awesome.
* I strongly recommend using PowerPoint to create your poster (Latex solution is an overkill for this class, since we are not adding equations to the poster). However, in Clinic, the poster template is in LaTeX (see Clinic/Summer research references section).

### Style Guidelines

**Layout, content, and flow**

Consistent layout (e.g., textbox width), efficient use of (white)space

Clear flow (logical progression of sections)

Concise (limit the amount of text)

Spell-checked

 

**Fonts**

Consistent fonts (style, size, and type)

Readable fonts, when printed and projected (also applies to large text)

 

**Visuals**

Meaningful, informative visuals (purposeful and specific to the project)

Images are effectively cropped

Clear, readable visuals, when printed and projected

Consistently labeled (e.g., Figure 1)

Captions are consistent and informative

 

**Colors**

Consistent, intentional color scheme
* visible colors (should be dark enough to be easily read)
* proper contrast (don't use dark text on a dark background or light text on a light background)

Color-blind friendly (at least, no red/green combo; instead of color, try to use texture / style as a differentiator, e.g., dashed lines)

Aesthetically pleasing and professional

 

_Note: Before you submit your poster on Canvas, do a simple sanity check: print your poster on a regular A4 sheet of paper, and see if it is still legible. Are you able to read it standing 5 feet away? If not, then it won't be clear even if we print it in full size._

### Rubric
This assignment will be graded on effort. Here is a rough breakdown:

* [1 pt] Freebie Logistics (Title, Developers and Clients)
* [4 pts] Content (Overview / Summary, Functionality, Architecture, Future Work)
* [4 pts] Style (limited text, diagrams and figures, clarity, spelling and overall quality)
* [1 pt] Writing Center (extra credit)

Remember, we will have an in-class poster feedback session, and the more effort you put into this assignment, the better your final poster (and presentation) will be.
