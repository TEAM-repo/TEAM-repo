# Poster Session

## Logistics

For the poster session, please prepare a **2 min** lightning talk (this is a hard limit). The goal of these talks is to motivate your audience to come check out your app in the second half of class. Common elements of a lighting talk (which is similar to an elevator pitch, just longer) include the following:

* What is the problem you are/were solving

* Why is that problem important / what is the impact of the problem

* What is your solution / how does your solution fix the problem

* What is the impact of the fix (for example, how much money / time / resource is saved because of your fix)

 

Before Friday's class, I will collate the posters into a single file and auto-advance the slides during the lightning talks. The whole team is strongly encouraged to plan the talk such that you can effectively present in the allotted time.

For the second half, there will be print-outs of each (electronically-submitted) poster around the classroom. If the team would like to have copies of the updated poster printed on the A4 sheets, then submit the *updated poster* PDF here.

During the poster session each team should have one representative explaining the poster, and the rest of the team can check out the other projects. I suggest you also have one (or more) web browsers loaded with your app so people can try it out. Feel free to rotate the teammate who is at the poster during this time.
