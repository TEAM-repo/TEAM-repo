# User Testing 

For user testing, the team is expected to have a couple of laptops ready to demo the product and explain its functionality.



Part of the team will be reviewing another team's product while the others will be demoing their product and capturing feedback.

I posted an example issue, which shows how the team can capture the feedback you receive:  https://github.com/hmc-cs121-admin/hmc-cs121-s2018/issues/1.  (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.At the end of the class, you'll need to submit the link to this issue on Canvas.



I suggest to present the most stable and robust prototype that you have: it is better for you to give your users something that you think is bullet-proof and for them to find issues or holes, than for you to show them the features that you know are buggy and for them to repeatedly point it out to you.



I also recommend that you show them your GitHub repo's README file with your project description / summary, and get their feedback on its clarity.
