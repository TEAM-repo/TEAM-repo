# PM Presentation Reflection

The goal of this assignment is to help you reflect on the content and professionalism of your presentation as a project manager, and on the feedback that you received from your peers. The objective is to help you create a plan for future presentations outside of this course.

I encourage you to discuss some of this feedback and insights with the next project manager to help them in preparing for their presentation.

*    Describe one thing that you did well in this presentation.
*    Comment on the content of your presentation: do you feel that you provided your audience with information that was clear and sufficient to understand your project? If you had to give this presentation over again, what would you change?
*    Comment on your eye contact, gestures and movement: were they effective? Why or why not? If not, how do you plan to improve for your next presentation?
*    Comment on your practice for this presentation: did you practice thoroughly? If you feel that you did not practice thoroughly, how will you modify your preparation or practice for your next presentation? Be specific.
*    What stood out the most from the feedback that you received from your peers? What suggestions and comments are you taking away from it?
