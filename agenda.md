# Agenda for the client-developer meeting MM/DD/20YY

Location and time:

PM: NAME ; 
Developers: NAME, NAME, NAME

Keep in mind the following notes as you are preparing for your first client meeting. The same notes apply for your future meetings (and are also part of the Clinic experience).

**Prepare an agenda**
* include the date and the names of the students on your team 
*list the main discussion points
* include relevant diagrams, mockups/wireframes, references
* list questions for the client
* outline potential action steps

It is great to **email the client(s) the agenda at least 1 day in advance**: it lets the
client put more thought into their answers and provides talking points during the meeting.

During the first meeting, discuss the scope of the project, potential user stories and use cases, mockups/wireframes, etc. It is also useful to clarify communication mechanisms: is the client willing to answer your questions outside of the scheduled meetings? If so, what’s the best way to reach them?

To wrap up the meeting, confirm with the client that you understood the requirements by outlining what your next action steps will be. For example, one year, at the end of the discussion, a PM went up to the board and sketched out a rough set of wireframes and their contents for different screens, which illustrated what the team understood about the client’s requirements. An added benefit of doing this was that the team could see a wireframe that had the most blank space was potentially the one that they were less clear about. These sketches offer a chance to ask the client additional questions about the missing parts.

By keeping a record of all of the meetings during the semester, a project team gains a clear understanding of where they have been and where they are going. The minutes should include:
* Date, time, location, and persons present
* Notes from the meeting discussion
* Accomplishments since last meeting and assignments for the next meeting
* Important changes in the status of the project (goals, schedule, task assignments, etc.)

After the meeting, it is a good idea for everyone to review the minutes to make sure that everything was captured properly and everyone remembers the tasks assigned to them. Meeting minutes will be submitted by the PM as part of the PM reports.
