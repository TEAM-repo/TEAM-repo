### Group Assignment 1: Logistics, and Project Preferences

The goal of this assignment is to ...

1. inform staff of your project logistics, including who will be project manager each phase,
2. find a time that your team can meet regularly every week (through experience, we have found that 
regular group work sessions are an excellent way to be productive), and
3. understand your own style as a team member, anticipate potential team dynamic issues that you might 
face this semester, and develop plans to mediate these issues before they arise.
