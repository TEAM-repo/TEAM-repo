# Project Manager Expectations

The Project Manager takes primary responsibility for overall project coordination, including:

    *    Planning and moderating meetings, including creating meeting agendas
    *    Coordinating with the client(s)/liaison(s) and faculty advisor
    *    Resolving general (non-technical) difficulties
    *    Ensuring the timely planning, completion, and submission of necessary deliverables
    *    Coordinating the assignment of tasks and team-members within the overall project.

Because of the increased administrative role, the project manager has reduced responsibilities on technical facets of the project (**PMs are not supposed to spend more than 75% of their time on technical development**).

Below is more information about the expectations for this role and tips for success:
*    As a Project Manager (PM), **you are a leader - not a dictator**
*    You will be a manager of the project for your development team. For each week, you should:
     +   Make sure project deliverables (e.g., write-ups) are completed (in collaboration with software developers).
     +   Make sure your team is working on the highest priority task(s) for your project.
     +   Assign tasks to software developers. Make sure there is consensus on and a way to measure what it means for a task to be "complete".
     +   Report team progress to staff through project status updates (in lieu of individual status updates).
     +   Schedule meetings with your team and the client as necessary. Prepare meeting agendas.
*    You will be the liaison for your client. This means:
     +   Asking questions of (and getting answers from) the client
     +   Note that you should consult with your team members, but only the PMs should be communicating directly with the client outside of class.
     +   For all client-developer meetings, the PMs should be setting the agenda and leading the discussion.
*    You will be responsible for a technical presentation (details forthcoming)
*    Finally, you can help out as developer for your team. While you're not expected to work a set number of hours, if you fall below 8 hours a week, you could probably help out more with development.
*    To allow you to focus on your PM responsibilities:
     +   you are allowed to code at most 6 hours per week -- this is a hard limit!
     +   make sure that the logistical tasks are sorted out before you take on coding tasks.
*    To help you with the transition from the PM to the developer, keep track of what the team is working on, which tasks are being completed, and how the work gets done. Unless you are the PM for the last phase, you will need to begin contributing to the development after your PM phase is over. This task would be easier for you if you stay in touch with the technical aspects of the development while you are the PM.
*    To ensure a smooth and effective transitions between the PMs, schedule a handoff meeting at the end of your phase to bring the next PM up to speed on the status of the project, and the logistics of scheduling and project deliverables' submission.
