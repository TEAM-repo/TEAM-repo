## Status report: Phase 0 (Week 2)

Make sure to read and follow all instructions (this text box scrolls down further).

Your weekly status report serves multiple purposes:

* It helps you organize your thoughts and plan your time, so that you can recognize when you're being efficient and when you're not.
* It helps assess your work (i.e., grading), and it helps make grading more transparent.
* It helps staff understand the project better, so that we can provide the best support and guidance that we possibly can.
* It helps make sure that the work is evenly distributed, i.e., that you're not doing the entire project yourself nor are you neglecting the project.

Your status report should cover either an entire week (Monday through Sunday). I encourage you to efficiently plan your work and get it done before the weekend. Submit your report by Sunday 11pm to get full credit for your work. For each day that the report is late, we will deduct ~20% penalty.

We recommend planning the tasks that you need to accomplish (e.g., looking at needs to get done as well as what's due in the next couple of weeks, your other commitments, etc.), writing down the tasks as SMART goals in your report, and then scheduling work time during the week. 

Throughout the week, keep track of the time you spend on the work for this course (e.g., homework, team/client meetings, design, coding, group assignments). Also keep track of any relevant notes that you can include in your report. As you accomplish your goals, update the report accordingly, noting relevant solutions or resources.

In your report, include the following sections:

* **Work Accomplished**

  In 2-5 consistently-formatted bullets, please explain your accomplishments from the previous week.

* **Total Hours**: How many hours did you work this week? (Round to the nearest 30 minutes)

* **Plans for Next Week**

  Please explain your plans for what to accomplish in the upcoming week. Make sure your plans seem reasonable for the required developer hours next week.

  **Incomplete Tasks**

  If your plans include any tasks from the previous week, please provide the following information:

  * Exactly what task was not completed.
  * Why this task was not completed.
  * What you could have done differently to avoid this.
  * What you will do to address any technical challenges.
  
  Note: Your plan must be a concrete deliverable, making it easy to decide whether or not you achieved this goal (make it SMART!). For example, "Learn how to use the OpenCV library"; might be motivation, but it is not an acceptable goal, because there is no objective way for us to agree whether you have learned OpenCV. In contrast, "Install OpenCV", "Complete Tutorial XXX on OpenCV", or "Build a prototype using OpenCV that does YYY" has a very clear success criterion.

* **Additional notes / comments**

  For example, you can identify something that went better this week than last week, and explain what actions you took to achieve this improvement, or you can describe either a technical or team dynamic challenge. For example,
 
  * Whether you completed all your tasks or not, describe an obstacle that you faced and how you dealt with it. This obstacle can be small (details of a particular technology or language) or large (something simply ended up not working). Tells us how you approached/solved this challenge.
  * Describe a group interaction that caused problems and how you dealt with it. For example, "XXX is dominating conversations. I have talked with him/her about periodically asking for ideas or feedback from the group."

* **Work Log**   
  Include a log of the tasks that you worked on along with the time estimations. I recommend the following format:
  
  Date:   
  Start-end time:   
  Task:   
  Time estimate:   
  Actual time:   
  Worked alone/with <name(s)>     
  Notes:    

If you keep track of your work, you should be able to complete a high-quality report in about 10-15 minutes, and you should schedule time to do so each week. Use it as a planning and time-management tool.

For your convenience, I included a sample Status Report template with an example:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UBUWX3Xb329ieOBhp9ooOxrv4tg2msLYkiHnqdqzMeM/edit?usp=sharing.  
Feel free to use "File -> Make a copy..." option to customize it for yourself. Remember to remove the example report and helper text before you submit your status report to us.

**To submit**: upload a pdf file of your status report + add a comment through Canvas' comment box with a link to the Google Doc with your status report.

1. Status report with the above sections filled out. Each week, add the new week's report to the top of the file.
2. Google doc link that has permissions set to be visible ("Can comment") to "Anyone with the link".

The Rubric for the reports is as follows:
* Full marks are given for a section that is well-written, clear, concise but with enough detail to understand the progress, and follows SMART guidelines.
* Half the credit is given if a section is too terse or too verbose, lacks sufficient detail to understand the progress, the tasks are not specific, measurable or relevant.
