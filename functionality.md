The goal of this assignment is to document the functionality of your app.  You will need a revised version of this document to include in your final project report submitted at the end of the semester.
Functionality

Each team must submit a project functionality overview to be shared with potential users. After going through your write-up, a user should be able to tell you what features your application currently offers and how to use them, if it's not obvious. If there are any features that are still in progress, clearly label them as such as part of your description.

Functionality Overview's intent is both to convince the user that they want your product and to inform an already existing user of all the features that you offer.

This write-up should include pictures, complete paragraphs, and whatever you think will best convey the functionality that you are offering. Your figures should be readable when printed on a regular A4 paper. Make sure to properly label and caption all your figures and tables, and reference them within the text.

Note: Real-world functionality report is a lot more complex. If you are curious (no need to use it for this assignment), here's an actual template for a functional requirements document: portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=DOC_15136.doc (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

I recommend that you take your draft to the Writing Center. The Writing Center provides a welcoming space for writers to get feedback on their composition projects, whether written, spoken or visual pieces. Writing Center Consultants are prepared to assist students in any discipline with any stage of the writing process, from developing an idea to polishing a final draft. Even the most accomplished writers benefit from seeking feedback at the writing center. The center is open Sunday through Thursday evenings from 7-11 and Saturday and Sunday afternoons from 3-5. It is located in Shanahan 1470, just up the walkway from the cafe. You may schedule an appointment through their website (https://www.hmc.edu/learning-programs/writing-center/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.), or you may simply drop in during normal hours. If you'd like an appointment outside of normal hours, you may email with your request.

YOU WILL LIKELY FIND YOUR WRITING CENTER VISIT MORE VALUABLE IF YOU GO EARLIER THAN THE NIGHT BEFORE YOUR FINAL DRAFT IS DUE.
Template (ProjectName_Functionality.pdf)

[I encourage you to write this document in LaTeX (use the template for the Phase Plan document). There is no page limit, but aim for conciseness; about 2-3 pages (excluding figures) should be enough.]

Project: <name of project under development>

Development Team: <name> (PM), <name>, â€¦

Client: <names>

Github: <link>

 

<Description of the functionality provided by your app. Use full sentences.>
Rubric

An approximate breakdown is as follows.

    [10 pts] Functionality
        [5 pts] The main functionality of your project is covered (at least at the level of your MVP).
        [2 pt] Your document is accessible to a non-technical user (e.g., no technical jargon).
        [2 pt] Your description is organized with a logical flow.
        [1 pt] The document is well-formatted, spell-checked, with proper figure/table references.
        [1 pt] writing center (extra credit)


Additionally, be sure that your document satisfies the following criteria:

*   Timeliness - The document was submitted before the deadline.
*   Readability - The content presented in the document should be well-formatted, clear, and readable.
*   Completion - The document is complete, and clearly written.
*   Accessibility - This document should be written such that someone not on your project can understand the content.
*   Depth - This document should include details that are specific to your project and help document the architecture of your project. For example, even if you are using the same framework as another team, the write-up should include your project-specific details, which are different than other teams.
