## Portfolio

The purpose of this assignment is to assemble your deliverables throughout the semester into a single PDF file, and to reflect on your experience, efficiency, and effectiveness.

You might look into LaTeX's options to compile the documents together. E.g., <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2739159/inserting-a-pdf-file-in-latex>

In your PDF assemble together:
* Status reports for all weeks, which include the PM project reports
* PM presentation reflection
* Postmortem reflection
* Extra credit submissions (if you had any)
* Portfolio reflection --> now that you have assembled and read-through your documents, have you gained any additional insights about your experience and performance? Provide your insights and corresponding evidence.

To submit:
_Email your PDF named CS121-Spring2018-Portfolio-Name.pdf to me (xxx@hmc.edu) with the subject "CS 121 Portfolio (Your name)"._   
I reserve the right to lower your grade if you don't follow the naming convention and don't include the proper subject line.


"The difference between average programmers and excellent developers is not a matter of knowing the latest language or buzzword-laden technique. Rather, it can boil down to something as simple as not making the same mistakes over and over again."
