## Description
The goal of this assignment is to promote open team reflection and planning. During the semester, the instructor will use these evaluations, along with your group assignments and weekly reports (with developer hours), to assess how well the team is working together, how efficient everyone is with planning, and progressing on delivering the final product. In future phases, students are expected to address concerns of their teammates, clients, and staff brought up in these evaluations.

I recommend that the Phase 3 Project Manager, with the help and discussion from the team, submits the following form reflecting on the work of the team and each teammate since Phase 1.

This assignment has two parts:

(1) Submit a single document per group reflecting on the work of your team and each teammate.

(2) Individual submission of the multiple-choice form: https://goo.gl/forms/I2nhQzUsW31bM0LX2.
