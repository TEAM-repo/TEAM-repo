# Evaluating an Open Source project

The purpose of this assignment is to allow you to explore various open-source projects and rank them based on the provided criteria to evaluate which one you'd like to contribute.

Here’s the direct link to the framework that you can use to rate and learn about various open source projects:

Since the assignment is optional, I’d like to use it as an opportunity to aid students who might need a bit of a boost to their grade. If you decide to complete it, you have a choice: your submission can count either as extra credit (which would be applied at the end of the semester if your grade is on the border), or we can apply up to 5 points toward one of your past status reports (Phases 0-3 only). If you choose the latter, submit a comment on your submission on Canvas, telling us which status report (not a project report) you’d like us to apply the credit.

 

Extra point if you submit the assignment as a link to a GitHub README.md with the table with your answers. 

 

Additionally, if you are interested in learning more about the open source world, here are a few helpful resources:

 

Wikipedia maintains a list of free and open-source software packages:
