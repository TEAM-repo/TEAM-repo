As part of the final deliverable, we will have a wrap-up/handoff meeting during the finals week. Our final meeting's aim is to make sure that the client / future developers / grutors & I are able to run the code in your Github repo. I'll meet with every team individually to go over the GitHub repo and discuss any other submission/project details.

To submit:

(1) provide the Github URL for your repo

(2) add your team's name on the meeting schedule to the time slot during which you are available:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/105r_IqQmWwYpH9SGKbUMFfDAOab8cTda6cViLsz9cXE/edit?usp=sharing (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. 

One of the main reasons I need the whole team to be there is because if I have a question about a particular component, someone who implemented it might be the best person to provide an answer. However, given that some students are unable to attend the meeting due to various circumstances, I wanted to make it explicit that they can remotely Skype-in/Hangout-in/appear.in during the time the team is meeting with me. However, at least one team member needs to be present in person for this meeting (the team is responsible for setting up the telecon on their computer).
Before our meeting make sure to add the following information to your GitHub repo:

1. If you haven't already, add a file called LICENSE.txt with the text for the MIT license that's found here: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

2. update your README.md using the template below. We are specifically interested in the installation process instructions (e.g., all the gems, loading real/seed data, etc.). Some of the other information (e.g., description/summary) you might already have in your final writeup, so you can include it where appropriate.

Provide a README file with the following information:

# Project Name

TODO: Write a compelling/creative/informative project description / summary

## Architecture

### Prerequisites

TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before running the installation instructions below (e.g., git, which versions of Ruby/Rails)

### Gems

TODO: List which gems you added to the project, and the purpose each gem serves in your app.

## Installation

TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you mention `bundle install`).
Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. 

## Functionality

TODO: Write usage instructions. Structuring it as a walkthrough can help structure this section,
and showcase your features.

## Known Problems

TODO: Describe any known issues, bugs, odd behaviors or code smells. 
Provide steps to reproduce the problem / name a file or a function where the problem lives.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

---
Make sure to check out the repo anew (potentially on a CIS/loaned laptop) and test your installation instructions.
