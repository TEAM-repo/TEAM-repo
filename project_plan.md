# Project Plan

**TODO** Copied below are the rubric instructions from Phase 3 Project Plan. 


...


The goal of this assignment is to plan out your overall project goals, describe your solution to the client’s problem and how it fits the client’s needs, how your team will accomplish this solution, and also your specific tasks for this phase.

Rubric

Full credit is given if a section is complete and well-written;
half credit is given if there are minor issues, half of the work is not done, and/or a section can be further improved;
more than half of the credit is taken off if a section can be substantially improved;
0 pts are given if a section is missing or is blank.

    Project Plan [37 pts]
        0.5 pts: Included required header (project, client, team).
        0.5 pts: Included a link to the GitHub repo.
        2 pts: GitHub Projects is populated with the tasks that are labeled as “chores” and/or “features”. Tasks for the phase are broken down into enough detail so that staff has a good idea of what each member is working on.
        24 pts: Good level of detail and completeness for each section.
            2 pts: A summary
            2 pts: A description of the problem
            2 pts: A list of the stakeholders in the project and their roles
            2 pts: Background research, including information about relevant tools and technologies
            6 pts: A description of your solution to the problem (2pts each)
                Describe your MVP
                Post-MVP features
                Stretch goals
            2 pts: Potential problems, risks, and solutions.
            8 pts: A timeline with milestones and deliverables. (2pts per phase)
                Timeline spans all phases.
                Timeline map for all phases covers each in high-level detail so clients and staff can understand the overall arc of the project.
                Epics' distribution seems sensible (e.g., epics are independent from each other).
                Project report, poster, and the finished product are part of the Phase 4 deliverables.
    5 pts: "Current Phase Plan" section conveys necessary information to client and staff as outlined above, corresponding roughly to client-focused understandable goals; there should be a logical flow, with high priority and high risk features earlier in the plan.
    5 pts: Overall quality of the document. Full points for A-level work; 4 pts for B-level work, and so on. For example, an A-level document satisfies the following criteria:
        Completion - The document is complete, clearly written, and submitted on time.
        Neatness - The document is spell-checked, is written using correct grammar, uses proper captions and references, includes effective visuals.
        Accessibility - This document should be written such that someone not on your project can understand the content.
        Depth - This document should include details that are specific to your project and help document your project. For example, even if you are using the same framework as another team, the write-up should include your project-specific details, which are different than other teams.

    2 pts extra credit for working with the Writing Center to improve prose and styling of the document.

    The Writing Center provides a welcoming space for writers to get feedback on their composition projects, whether written, spoken or visual pieces. Writing Center Consultants are prepared to assist students in any discipline with any stage of the writing process, from developing an idea to polishing a final draft. Even the most accomplished writers benefit from seeking feedback at the writing center. The center is open Sunday through Thursday evenings from 7-11 and Saturday and Sunday afternoons from 3-5. It is located in Shanahan 1470, just up the walkway from the cafe. You may schedule an appointment through their website, or you may simply drop in during normal hours. If you'd like an appointment outside of normal hours, you may email with your request.

    YOU WILL LIKELY FIND YOUR WRITING CENTER VISIT MORE VALUABLE IF YOU GO EARLIER THAN THE NIGHT BEFORE YOUR FINAL DRAFT IS DUE.











Same guidelines as the Phase 1 Project Plan apply here. Make sure you update your plan to address previous feedback, incorporate changes that happened in Phase 2, and reflect the current state of your project.
